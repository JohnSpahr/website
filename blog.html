          <h2>Linux Saved My MacBook Air</h2>
          <p>Several months ago, I got an 11 inch 2015 MacBook Air. Mine is the model with the Core i5, 128 gig SSD, and 8 gigs of RAM. The hardware is still pretty nice. Yeah, the screen’s kind of bad and low-res. Admittedly, the lack of newer ports is a frustration. The speakers suck. It’s definitely a decade-old laptop.</p>
          <p>However, this laptop is still amazing in a few ways. For one, it’s super compact and light. It’s delightful how portable it is. I can throw it in a bag and forget about it. MagSafe 2 works great, and the two type A ports are handy for sure. The keyboard is solid, as it’s not the infamous Butterfly keyboard. The touchpad is small but fine. Finally, it’s still quite snappy! The reapplied thermal paste and SSD definitely help with this, but the biggest improvement came from switching operating systems.</p>
          <p>Look, I love macOS. It’s great on my MacBook Pro. Sadly, Monterey is the latest official release that  this MacBook can run, which is a little old. Initially, I tried to install Sonoma via OpenCore Patcher, but it didn’t work well. The graphics driver had a lot of issues, and bear in mind that Sonoma isn’t even the latest version. It was really rough.</p>
          <p>Linux was the obvious answer. First, I tried elementaryOS, but it struggled to recognize the EFI partition no matter what I tried. It simply didn’t work, and I didn’t have the patience to keep dealing with it.</p>
          <p>Next was Ubuntu Budgie. I thought it looked good and would work nicely. Not so. Turns out that it hates the Broadcom wifi chip in this thing. The driver did not work well. Also, I had to screw around in the terminal to get it to suspend when I closed the MacBook’s lid. Notice a pattern here? I do. Hardware compatibility issues were popping up at every turn.</p>
          <p>Finally, I landed on the latest release of Zorin OS. I preferred the UI to plain Ubuntu. Once I got it installed, I was pleasantly surprised. Things just worked! No driver issues were apparent. Shutting the lid shut it off. Best of all, it was super quick! Even after installing my usual apps, it had no problem juggling Chrome tabs and doing the light work that I use this ultra-portable laptop for.</p>
          <p>Linux is frustrating. Things don’t <i>just work</i>. I understand why some people don’t want to mess with it. But the reward was worth it. Zorin OS makes this little MacBook not just usable, but fun to use. Its shortcomings are easily eclipsed by its performance and excellent portability. It’s perfect for small lecture hall desks.</p>
          <p>For under $100, and with a little patience, a Linux-powered 2015 MacBook Air 11” is an incredible value. I can’t wait to keep using it over the coming years.</p>

          <h2>Clicks Communicator: My Thoughts</h2>
          <p><i>Feb 2, 2026</i></p>
          <p>
            Recently, a product announcement piqued my interest. Behold,
            <a href="https://clicksphone.com" target="_blank"
              ><b>the Clicks Communicator</b></a
            >! To put it simply, this is a modern, Android-powered,
            BlackBerry-like keyboard phone. And I want so badly to be excited
            for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Theoretically, it has everything I need: Full access to the Play
            Store, Android Auto, modern specs, long-term update support, and 5G
            connectivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            What rubs me the wrong way is how it's been announced. I think it's
            odd to be taking early bird preorders without even showing a working
            demo of the product. Even if a refund would be issued if things feel
            through, a competent phone is a very hard product to make. Not
            having a working prototype to show us and relying on 3D models does
            not inspire confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's for this reason that I have not preordered. Even though early
            birds get a sizable discount, I don't want to gamble on a product
            that might have a lot of issues and I haven't even seen yet. To its
            credit, Clicks has released multiple keyboard accessories already,
            but those are a lot less involved than making a proper modern(ish)
            phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it works well, though, then I'm all in. My iPhone 15 Pro has some
            great things about it, like iMessage, Mac integration, and all the
            perks of a flagship smartphone. The problem is that it feels like a
            burden to me. I don't believe that buying a product is the right way
            to fix your relationship with technology at all, but I do think a
            phone less tailored to doom scrolling could be nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of unknowns, and this first-generation product could
            really suck... Assuming it sees the light of day. I have no doubts
            about the talent or expertise of the Clicks team. Hell, I've been
            watching Mr. Mobile religiously since 2018. It's just that there are
            a lot of hurdles, and I'd rather pay the premium than gamble on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess by the standards of my Risk Management Insurance class, that
            makes me risk-averse. But I will take the leap of faith if the
            Communicator makes it to production and works well enough. Even if
            it has some flaws, I'm still all in. I love physical keyboards and
            the idea of owning something unique. That said, only time will tell.
            Fingers crossed.
          </p>

          <h2>Games I've Played Recently</h2>
          <p><i>Jan 31, 2026</i></p>
          <p>
            The Xbox 360 was my childhood, and I've recently gotten back into
            playing it. Here are the games I've been enjoying and my thoughts on
            them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Portal 1/2:</b> I played through both Portals on the 360, and
              it was a blast. I seriously think that Portal 2 is one of the best
              games ever made. The characters are delightful (Wheatley, my
              beloved) and exploring the different phases of Aperture is super
              cool. It's a must play for the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Minecraft:</b> This one is pretty basic. I still think console
              edition is awesome, though. I don't care for Bedrock.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Terraria:</b> I've had fun with Terraria. I haven't killed any
              bosses or anything yet, but mining has been fun. Great game and a
              cozy play.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mirror's Edge:</b> What an underrated game. The visuals are
              beautiful, as is the music. It pissed me off on many occasions,
              but finishing it was so rewarding. Faith's parkour mechanics are
              very unforgiving, but that works in the game's favor. This game
              deserves a lot more love.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bejeweled 2:</b> Best Bejeweled soundtrack and a lot of fun
              puzzles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Battle Block Theater:</b> Quirky platformer with fun
              multiplayer. Good stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Alan Wake:</b> I just started this one! The story is intriguing
              and the flashlight mechanic is really unique. I've been having a
              great time with it thus far.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The 360 has so many great games, so it should keep me entertained
            for many more years. The new Xboxes may be technically superior, but
            the 360 is timeless and way more interesting to me. I adore it! And
            seriously, these games are great. Try them out!
          </p>
