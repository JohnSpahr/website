          <h2>Games I've Played Recently</h2>
          <p><i>Jan 31, 2026</i></p>
          <p>
            The Xbox 360 was my childhood, and I've recently gotten back into
            playing it. Here are the games I've been enjoying and my thoughts on
            them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Portal 1/2:</b> I played through both Portals on the 360, and
              it was a blast. I seriously think that Portal 2 is one of the best
              games ever made. The characters are delightful (Wheatley, my
              beloved) and exploring the different phases of Aperture is super
              cool. It's a must play for the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Minecraft:</b> This one is pretty basic. I still think console
              edition is awesome, though. I don't care for Bedrock.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Terraria:</b> I've had fun with Terraria. I haven't killed any
              bosses or anything yet, but mining has been fun. Great game and a
              cozy play.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mirror's Edge:</b> What an underrated game. The visuals are
              beautiful, as is the music. It pissed me off on many occasions,
              but finishing it was so rewarding. Faith's parkour mechanics are
              very unforgiving, but that works in the game's favor. This game
              deserves a lot more love.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bejeweled 2:</b> Best Bejeweled soundtrack and a lot of fun
              puzzles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Battle Block Theater:</b> Quirky platformer with fun
              multiplayer. Good stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Alan Wake:</b> I just started this one! The story is intriguing
              and the flashlight mechanic is really unique. I've been having a
              great time with it thus far.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The 360 has so many great games, so it should keep me entertained
            for many more years. The new Xboxes may be technically superior, but
            the 360 is timeless and way more interesting to me. I adore it! And
            seriously, these games are great. Try them out!

            Welcome to the blog! These will be bite-sized posts about anything
            that interests me. Think of it like a microblog. Making this
            90s-inspired website has been on my bucket list, and it's incredible
            to see it finally materializing. This will be the start of something
            great. So, buckle up, because this blog is about to get crazy.
            Woohoo!
