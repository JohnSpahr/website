          <h2>Clicks Communicator: My Thoughts</h2>
          <p><i>Feb 2, 2026</i></p>
          <p>
            Recently, a product announcement piqued my interest. Behold,
            <a href="https://clicksphone.com" target="_blank"
              ><b>the Clicks Communicator</b></a
            >! To put it simply, this is a modern, Android-powered,
            BlackBerry-like keyboard phone. And I want so badly to be excited
            for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Theoretically, it has everything I need: Full access to the Play
            Store, Android Auto, modern specs, long-term update support, and 5G
            connectivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            What rubs me the wrong way is how it's been announced. I think it's
            odd to be taking early bird preorders without even showing a working
            demo of the product. Even if a refund would be issued if things feel
            through, a competent phone is a very hard product to make. Not
            having a working prototype to show us and relying on 3D models does
            not inspire confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's for this reason that I have not preordered. Even though early
            birds get a sizable discount, I don't want to gamble on a product
            that might have a lot of issues and I haven't even seen yet. To its
            credit, Clicks has released multiple keyboard accessories already,
            but those are a lot less involved than making a proper modern(ish)
            phone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it works well, though, then I'm all in. My iPhone 15 Pro has some
            great things about it, like iMessage, Mac integration, and all the
            perks of a flagship smartphone. The problem is that it feels like a
            burden to me. I don't believe that buying a product is the right way
            to fix your relationship with technology at all, but I do think a
            phone less tailored to doom scrolling could be nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are a lot of unknowns, and this first-generation product could
            really suck... Assuming it sees the light of day. I have no doubts
            about the talent or expertise of the Clicks team. Hell, I've been
            watching Mr. Mobile religiously since 2018. It's just that there are
            a lot of hurdles, and I'd rather pay the premium than gamble on it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I guess by the standards of my Risk Management Insurance class, that
            makes me risk-averse. But I will take the leap of faith if the
            Communicator makes it to production and works well enough. Even if
            it has some flaws, I'm still all in. I love physical keyboards and
            the idea of owning something unique. That said, only time will tell.
            Fingers crossed.
          </p>

          <h2>Games I've Played Recently</h2>
          <p><i>Jan 31, 2026</i></p>
          <p>
            The Xbox 360 was my childhood, and I've recently gotten back into
            playing it. Here are the games I've been enjoying and my thoughts on
            them:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Portal 1/2:</b> I played through both Portals on the 360, and
              it was a blast. I seriously think that Portal 2 is one of the best
              games ever made. The characters are delightful (Wheatley, my
              beloved) and exploring the different phases of Aperture is super
              cool. It's a must play for the system.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Minecraft:</b> This one is pretty basic. I still think console
              edition is awesome, though. I don't care for Bedrock.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Terraria:</b> I've had fun with Terraria. I haven't killed any
              bosses or anything yet, but mining has been fun. Great game and a
              cozy play.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Mirror's Edge:</b> What an underrated game. The visuals are
              beautiful, as is the music. It pissed me off on many occasions,
              but finishing it was so rewarding. Faith's parkour mechanics are
              very unforgiving, but that works in the game's favor. This game
              deserves a lot more love.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Bejeweled 2:</b> Best Bejeweled soundtrack and a lot of fun
              puzzles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Battle Block Theater:</b> Quirky platformer with fun
              multiplayer. Good stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Alan Wake:</b> I just started this one! The story is intriguing
              and the flashlight mechanic is really unique. I've been having a
              great time with it thus far.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The 360 has so many great games, so it should keep me entertained
            for many more years. The new Xboxes may be technically superior, but
            the 360 is timeless and way more interesting to me. I adore it! And
            seriously, these games are great. Try them out!
          </p>

            that interests me. Think of it like a microblog. Making this

            to see it finally materializing. This will be the start of something
            great. So, buckle up, because this blog is about to get crazy.
            Woohoo!
