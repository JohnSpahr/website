          <h2>"When We Were Friends"</h2>
          <p><i>The Backseat Lovers</i></p>
          <p>
            Heartbroken emo guy music. Can't go wrong with that! My picks are
            "Kilby Girl" and "Maple Syrup."
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>"Breach"</h2>
          <p><i>Twenty One Pilots</i></p>
          <p>
            This is the first TOP album I've really enjoyed. The songs are
            bangers and it's great to drive to. It's been the soundtrack for an
            iconic day or two. "Cottonwood" is sure to get you in the feels and
            "RAWFEAR" is dangerously catchy.

        <div class="card">
          <h2>"Violator"</h2>
          <p><i>Depeche Mode</i></p>
          <p>
            This album is probably one the greatest electronic works ever
            created. Start to finish, this is an amazing album that is arguably
            Depeche Mode's most refined work.

        <div class="card">
          <h2>"Currents"</h2>
          <p><i>Tame Impala</i></p>
          <p>
            Talk about a sentimental album. "Reality in Motion" is an all-time
            classic. I love every single song.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>"Linger"</h2>
          <p><i>The Cranberries</i></p>
          <p>Possibly the most beautiful song ever. Goddamn.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>"It's Not Safe to Leave This House"</h2>
          <p><i>REDACTED</i></p>
          <p>
            Amazing song. Such beautiful strings. Not putting the artist name
            here, though.

        <div class="card">
          <h2>"Extra Life"</h2>
          <p><i>Crushed</i></p>
          <p>
            EP with a 90s dreampop vibe. Can't explain, but it's a banger. I
            really like "Coil." Give it a listen!
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>"LP 3"</h2>
          <p><i>American Football</i></p>
          <p>
            A very cozy yet sad album. I love to throw this one on the turntable
            when I'm staying in. Huge vibe.
